- title: Student, Ecole Nationale Polytechnique, Algeria
  from: Sept. 2017
  to: Jul. 2022
  description: After passing my baccalauréat (average 17.48/20), I entered the classes préparatoires aux grandes écoles d'ingénieurs where I studied mathematics, chemistry, physics and computer science for two years (top 1% of the class). At the end of the two years, I took the national competitive entrance exam to engineering schools where I ranked 5/1080 nationally (top 0.5%). I went on to study engineering in general electronics where I acquired definite skills in advanced signal and image processing, digital telecommunications, embedded computing and artificial intelligence. I concluded my engineering studies with a state engineering diploma in electronics and a master's degree in signal and communication.

# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. at the Laboratory of Computer Science and Systems (LIS) at Centrale Méditerranée in Marseille, under the supervision of Dr. <a href="https://www.fresnel.fr/perso/khalighi/">Ali Khalighi</a> and Dr. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jean-Marc-Boi">Jean-Marc Boï</a>, with a particular focus on the physical layer of underwater wireless optical communication (UWOC) and water-to-air (W2A) systems. My research primarily involves modeling optical wireless channels and leveraging artificial intelligence for signal detection, demodulation, and decoding in UWOC and W2A channels.

Alongside my research, I serve as a lecturer at Aix-Marseille University and Centrale Méditerranée, teaching modules on telecommunications, antenna processing, and the Internet of Things (IoT).

Prior to beginning my doctoral studies, I worked as a Data Analyst at Décathlon El-Djazair, where I led the Data team. During this experience, I contributed to numerous projects for finance, commercial, and logistics teams in a technically advanced and diverse environment, utilizing tools such as AWS, GCP, DataBricks, DBT, Airflow, GitHub Actions, and Python.

Additionally, I hold a double degree from the <a href="https://www.enp.edu.dz/fr/">National Polytechnic School</a>, including an engineering degree in general electronics and a master's in signal and communications, which I obtained in 2022.
